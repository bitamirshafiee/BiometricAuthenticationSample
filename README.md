<img src=“https://www.dropbox.com/s/t8rnpot8efqlfow/fingerprin_success.jpg?dl=0">git

In this sample I use :
```
implementation 'androidx.biometric:biometric:1.0.1'
```
dependency to authenticate a user.
in this sample with the help of  'BiometricHelper' you tell the user below messages according their device hardware :

- Biometrics available for authentication
- No biometric features available on this device.
- Biometric features are currently unavailable.
- you have not associated any biometric credentials with your account.
- fingerprint is unavailable
